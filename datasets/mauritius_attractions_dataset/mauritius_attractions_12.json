    "description": "Île aux Bénitiers is a large, coral-sand islet situated off the southwestern coast of Mauritius, near the villages of La Gaulette and Le Morne. The islet is a popular destination for day trips, known for its pristine beaches, coconut plantations, and breathtaking views of the iconic Le Morne Brabant mountain. Historically a quiet islet, it has become a major tourist hub, offering a variety of activities including dolphin watching, snorkeling, and beach barbecues. The islet’s name is a source of confusion, possibly derived from the giant clamshells ('bénitiers') or the nearby 'Crystal Rock' which resembles one. However, recent government action in March 2025 has led to the indefinite closure of the island to address years of environmental degradation and a lack of proper permits for commercial activities, with a plan for rehabilitation.",
